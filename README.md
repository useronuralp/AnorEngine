# Anor Engine
Developing a game engine for practice

-First of all you need to run the 'GenerateProjects.bat' file to get windows specific visual studio files.

-After creating the projects, you also need to navigate to AnorEngie/Vendor/Assimp/assimp and run a cmake command on the file 'CMakeLists.txt' file using the command line and get project files for the assimp library.

-Go into ALL_BUILD.sln and build the binaries in RELEASE mode. This is important.

-Now you can safely run AnorEngine.sln and build the engine itself.

-Enjoy!
